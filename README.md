# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project was to analyze how the different crowdfunding campaigns did based on their launch dates, and on the goals.

### Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart 

What particular period of the year was suitable for what campaign – was it successful if it was launched in May or was it successful if it was launched in February.

The excel sheet ‘Theatre Outcomes by Launched Date’ shows exactly this data. In this particular sheet, it is filtered by the main category ‘Theatre’. We can select any category by selecting different filters like food, games, music, etc.


### Outcomes Based on the Goals Chart

This spreadsheet shows the success/failure of the campaigns based on the goals (dollar amount). Did the campaign work well if the goal was higher than e.g. $5000, or did it fail because the goal was a bit higher?

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

From the following area highlighted in green we can see that the most successful campaigns were started in mid-year.

From this table below, we can see that even though the number of campaigns were almost same at the beginning and the end of the year, percentage of failed campaigns, were more towards the end of the year.		

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The little bit difficult part, initially, was creating the formulas columns, but it got easier as it was practiced more. 


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

1). The campaigns that were launched around the middle of the year -May, June- were more successful.

2). By the end of the year – Nov, Dec, the percentage of campaigns failed increased.


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  Lower the amount range for the goals, higher the percentage of being it      successful.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
There was so much of data that was kind of not useful, irrelevant. If we can delete/hide those columns, we can focus more on the important data.
If there were some data about why the particular campaign failed in particular region – short on resources, or any other reason, that would help correcting it, and making it successful.


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Additional graphs for Subcategories would be helpful to further drill down on success/failure of the campaign.
